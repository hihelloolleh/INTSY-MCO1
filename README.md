# DLSU Eateries Pathfinding Simulation

## Overview

This project explores the implementation of blind search and heuristic search algorithms to simulate optimal pathfinding for eateries around De La Salle University (DLSU). The primary algorithms utilized in this simulation are Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A*, which are designed to adapt dynamically to changes in the state space, such as the addition of new eateries or the closure of existing ones.

## Algorithms Used

	•	Uniform Cost Search (UCS): A blind search algorithm that explores the least costly path first.
	•	A*: A heuristic search algorithm that employs heuristics to efficiently guide the search process toward the goal.

## How to Use the Program
